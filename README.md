# Agent-Based Sensory Creatures
Base page for the Agent-Based Sensory Creatures Launchpad

## Overview

This launchpad covers agent-based modeling, using sensory creatures to do so. In agent-based modeling, you have any number of 'agents', usually groups of similar things such as products or creatures, and by giving each agent it's own rules, you can observe how these agents interact with each other, with their environment (if you give them one), and anything else you provide them rules for. In this way you can model different situations and senarios and see what would come of them.

The creatures in the example have only a single sense with which to interact -- touch. You can change this as part of your extension -- either adding senses or changing the one currently used. An example of this would be giving everything 'auras' to add in smell. You can also change the number of agents (currently two, predator and prey), change the rules of the interactions, create a completely different model/simulation, or anything else that seems relevant to this launchpad. If you're not sure, feel free to ask.
